# learningGolang
My first attempt at learning Golang using a Udemy Course provided by Todd McLeod. I will be storing some of my approach to his exercises here. Feel free to take a look and we can discuss other approaches :)

1) I will be following the videos sequentially and coding down some of the important keywords and features of Go
2) Exercises will be stored in ```Exercises``` directory and Todd has a cool way of naming them by ninja levels so I will be going with it as well.
3) The higher the ```Ninja Level``` the more complex and in depth the exercise will be.
4) ```Keywords``` in Go
